Dockerfile and other configs for dockerizing my python + html5 + js app

To combine the Python Flask API app and the HTML5 frontend in a Dockerfile, you can follow these steps:

1.  Create a new directory for the project, and navigate into it:

    bash

-   `mkdir myapp
    cd myapp`

    -   Create a new file called `Dockerfile` in the project directory:

    bash

    -   `touch Dockerfile`

    -   Open the `Dockerfile` in a text editor, and add the following contents:

    sql

    -   `FROM python:3.8

    WORKDIR /app

    COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
    RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

    COPY . .

    EXPOSE 5000

    CMD ["python", "app.py"]`

    -   Save and close the `Dockerfile`.

    -   Create a new file called `requirements.txt` in the project directory, and add the following contents:

    -   `flask
    requests`

    -   Save and close the `requirements.txt` file.

    -   Copy the `app.py` file for the Python Flask API app into the project directory.

    -   Copy the HTML5 frontend files into a new directory called `static` in the project directory. The directory structure should look like this:

    markdown

    -   `myapp/
     - app.py
     - Dockerfile
     - requirements.txt
     - static/
     - index.html
     - script.js
     - style.css`

    -   Open the `app.py` file in a text editor, and add the following lines to serve the static HTML files:

    python

1.  `from flask import Flask, render_template

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        return render_template('index.html')`

2.  Save and close the `app.py` file.

3.  Open a terminal window, and navigate to the project directory.

4.  Build the Docker image by running the following command:

`docker build -t myapp .`

1.  Run the Docker container by running the following command:

css

`docker run -d -p 5000:5000 myapp`

1.  Open a web browser, and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to see the application running.

This should combine the Python Flask API app and the HTML5 frontend in a Docker container, and allow you to access the application through a web browser.
